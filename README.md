# Google Ads API Demo Web App

## About this Project
The Google Ads dashboard provides a useful UI for users to create and measure their campaigns, but the platform is limited in scale and customization for users with thousands of accounts that need to be accessed. The Google Ads API provides a solution to these limitations by providing the opportunity to develop around a code base, but less experienced developers have historically struggled with integrating the API into their own web application, especially in regards to the OAuth 2.0 web flow, thus introducing the need for a demonstrative, open source application. This application can be used as a starter project or as an example of how to use the Ads APIs.

> Front End with React
